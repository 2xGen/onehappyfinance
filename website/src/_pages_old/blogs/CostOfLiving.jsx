      <BlogLayout title="Cost of Living in Aruba (2025 Guide)">
        <p>Aruba is a dream destination, but what does it actually cost to live on this "One Happy Island"? While it offers a high quality of life, it's also known for having a higher cost of living compared to many other Caribbean islands, primarily because most goods are imported. Hereâ€™s a realistic breakdown of the main expenses for 2025.</p>

        <h2>Housing Costs</h2>
        <p>This will be your biggest expense. Prices vary significantly by location and property type.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rent (monthly):</strong> A one-bedroom apartment can range from $1,000 to $1,800 USD. A three-bedroom home can be anywhere from $2,000 to $4,500+, especially in prime areas like Noord.</li>
          <li><strong>Buying:</strong> The average home price hovers around $350,000 - $500,000, but luxury properties can easily exceed $1 million.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Utilities</h2>
        <p>Utilities are notoriously expensive in Aruba due to the island's reliance on desalination and imported fuel.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Electricity & Water:</strong> For a standard home, expect to pay between $250 and $500+ per month. Air conditioning is the main driver of high electricity bills.</li>
          <li><strong>Internet & Cable TV:</strong> A reliable high-speed internet package will cost around $100 - $150 per month.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Groceries</h2>
        <p>Since most food is imported, grocery bills are higher than in the US or Europe. Shopping at local supermarkets like Super Food and Ling & Sons is common.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Monthly estimate:</strong> A couple can expect to spend around $800 - $1,200 per month on groceries.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Transportation</h2>
        <p>Having a car is almost essential for getting around the island.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gasoline:</strong> Gas prices are regulated by the government and are generally higher than in the US.</li>
            <li><strong>Car Ownership:</strong> Expect to pay significant import duties on new and used cars, making them more expensive than you might be used to.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Healthcare</h2>
        <p>Aruba has a good healthcare system. Residents are required to have general health insurance (AZV). Expats often supplement this with private insurance for more comprehensive coverage.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Private Insurance:</strong> Costs can range from $200 to $500 per month depending on coverage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Summary: Estimated Monthly Budget</h2>
        <p>For a comfortable lifestyle, a couple living in Aruba can expect to spend approximately:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Modest Lifestyle:</strong> $3,500 - $4,500 per month</li>
            <li><strong>Comfortable/Luxury Lifestyle:</strong> $5,000 - $7,000+ per month</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While the cost of living in Aruba is high, many residents find that the island's safety, beautiful environment, and high quality of life make it a worthwhile investment.</p>
