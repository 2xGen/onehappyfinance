      <BlogLayout title="5 Common Mistakes When Applying for a Mortgage in Aruba">
        <p>Securing a mortgage is a huge step toward owning your piece of paradise in Aruba. However, the process can be complex, and a few common missteps can delay or even derail your dream. Here are five critical mistakes to avoid when applying for a mortgage in Aruba.</p>

        <h2>1. Not Getting Pre-Approved</h2>
        <p>Many buyers start house hunting before they know what they can actually afford. A mortgage pre-approval from a bank gives you a clear budget and shows sellers that you are a serious, qualified buyer. This puts you in a much stronger negotiating position.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Underestimating Closing Costs</h2>
        <p>The purchase price is not the final price. In Aruba, closing costs can be substantial and are typically the buyer's responsibility. These include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Transfer Tax:</strong> Usually 3% to 6% of the property value.</li>
          <li><strong>Notary Fees:</strong> Around 2% of the purchase price.</li>
          <li><strong>Mortgage Deed Fees:</strong> Approximately 1% of the loan amount.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Failing to budget for these (an extra 6-9% on top of the price) can create a major financial shortfall at closing.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Only Talking to One Bank</h2>
        <p>Interest rates, fees, and lending conditions can vary significantly between banks in Aruba. Don't just go to your primary bank out of convenience. Shop around and compare offers from at least two to three different lenders to ensure you get the most favorable terms.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Providing Incomplete or Disorganized Paperwork</h2>
        <p>Aruban banks require extensive documentation to process a mortgage application, including proof of income, tax returns, bank statements, and details on existing debts. Non-residents may need even more paperwork. Having your documents disorganized or incomplete is the number one cause of delays. Prepare everything meticulously beforehand.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Ignoring Your Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)</h2>
        <p>Your DTI is the percentage of your gross monthly income that goes toward paying your monthly debt payments. Banks in Aruba use this as a key metric to determine your ability to repay a loan. Before applying, try to pay down high-interest debts like credit card balances or personal loans to improve your DTI and increase your chances of approval.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>By avoiding these common pitfalls, you can navigate the mortgage process in Aruba more smoothly and confidently. Preparation is key to turning your dream of homeownership into a reality.</p>
